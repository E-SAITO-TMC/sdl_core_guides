# Creating the HMI UI

## First Steps 

Before starting the development of the SDL HMI user interface, there are a few RPC prerequisites that are required. 
Please refer to the guide `Getting Started Part 2`, which covers establishing a connection to SDL Core, registering the
HMI's sub-components, and subscribing to SDL Core notifications.

The minimum prerequisites from that guide for implementing an SDL compatible user interface are:

1. Establish an HMI websocket connection to SDL Core.
2. Register at minimum the following components: BasicCommunication, Buttons, and UI.
3. Send Core the BasicCommunication.OnReady notification.
4. Respond to each components' `IsReady` request.
5. Subscribe to the following Core notifications: 
    - `BasicCommunication.OnAppRegistered`
    - `BasicCommunication.OnAppUnregistered`
    - `BasicCommunication.OnPutFile`
    - `Buttons.OnButtonSubscription`

## Creating the App List

When there are changes to the registered apps list, Core will send the HMI a `BasicCommunication.UpdateAppList` RPC request. This request contains an array of applications' information. The HMI should use the information to update its internal app list state and app list display.

For each app listed in the `UpdateAppList` request, the HMI's App List should show a button that includes the app's name and icon.

If an app is disconnected or unregistered, Core will send an UpdateAppList request to the HMI and that application will not be included in the app list array.

The HMI should make sure its app list is always up to date, and only shows applications included in the most recent UpdateAppList request.

## Activating an Application

### User Selection

When the user selects an application from the app list, we define this action as "activating" an application. The first step required by the HMI after the user selects an app from the app list, is for the HMI to send a `SDL.ActivateApp` request to Core. 

When Core responds with a successful `SDL.ActivateApp` response, the HMI can switch views from the app list to the app's default template.

!!! NOTE
The default template for an app should be used if the app has not requested to use a template via `UI.SetDisplayLayout`(deprecated) or `UI.Show`'s `templateConfiguration` parameter.

The default template for media apps is `MEDIA`, and the default template for all other apps should be `NON-MEDIA`.

You can check if the app is a media application from the app's `isMediaApplication` parameter sent in the `BasicCommunication.UpdateAppList` request. 
!!!

### User Consent

If the `SDL.ActivateApp` response returns with the parameter `isPermissionsConsentNeeded = true`, the HMI should send a `SDL.GetListOfPermissions` request. This happens when the activating app requires permissions that the user must consent to. For example, if an app wants to access vehicle data, an SDL policy configuration might require the user consents to the app collecting this information. 

After receiving the list of permissions for the app, the HMI should show the user the `PermissionItem` name and status for each requested permission. The user should have the ability to enable or disable each permission item. If any permission changes are made by the user, these updates should be communicated to core via `SDL.OnAppPermissionConsent` notification.

!!! NOTE
Permissions are managed by SDL Core's policy table.
!!!

### Resumption

If an app is disconnected from SDL Core and reconnects within a specified time limit, Core will try to resume the app into the same HMI state the app was in before resumption. The HMI should expect a `BasicCommunication.ActivateApp` request from SDL Core, and return the app into the requested state. For example, if the requested HMI level is `FULL`, the HMI should activate the app and put that app's template into view.

!!! NOTE
`BasicCommunication.ActivateApp` and the previously described `SDL.ActivateApp` RPC are easy to get confused. 

`SDL.ActivateApp` is a request originating from the HMI and should be sent when the user selects an app to activate.

`BasicCommunication.ActivateApp` is a request originating from SDL Core to put an app into a requested tate. It is usually received by the HMI during app resumption.
!!!

## Displaying Information

When an app wants to display information on the head unit, the HMI will receive a `UI.Show` request. The `UI.Show` request provides the HMI with the text, soft button information, and images an app has requested to display. The HMI should store the information in these requests for when an app activated and put into full. `UI.Show` requests are not always sent when an app is activated and in view.

!!! NOTE

The HMI should merge the information in `UI.Show` requests with existing show information received for an app. 

If an HMI receives a request with text parameter`mainfield1` and a second request with text parameter `mainfield2`, the HMI should display both `mainfield1` and `mainfield2`.

If an app wants to clear information sent in a previous `UI.Show` request, SDL Core will send the HMI a request with that parameters value set to an empty string ("").

!!!

## Implementing Soft Buttons

A `Softbutton` received from a `UI.Show` request should be displayed when the app is displaying a template. A template can have a max of 8 `Softbuttons`. These buttons can be of type `TEXT`, `IMAGE`, or `BOTH`.

The HMI should keep an internal state of `SoftButtons` received by `UI.Show` requests, similar to how text fields and graphics are stored. Each `SoftButton` has a unique ID and must be saved by the HMI. The ID's are used in any message notification to SDL Core when a user interacts with a `SoftButton`

The actions expected of the HMI when the user selects a `SoftButton` are:
 - HMI Sends a notification `UI.OnButtonEvent` with mode = `DOWN` when the user presses a button.
 - HMI Sends a notification `UI.OnButtonEvent` with mode = `UP` when the user releases a button.
 - HMI Sends a notification `UI.OnButtonPress` with mode = `SHORT` or `LONG`, depending on how long the user held the button in a down state. 

!!! NOTE
Not all HMIs support the ability to detect a button press duration, or differentiate between an up and down button event. In this case the HMI should make sure its ButtonCapabilities are accurately sent to core via the `ButtonCapabilities` parameter in `UI.GetCapabilities`. 

More on HMI capabilities are covered later in this guide.
!!!

## Switching Templates

SDL Core will request the HMI to change an apps template from a `UI.Show` request, or the deprecated RPC `UI.SetDisplayLayout`.

The `UI.Show` request has a parameter `templateConfiguration` which includes a string for the requested layout.

The `UI.SetDisplayLayout` request includes a string parameter, `displayLayout`.

`UI.Show` is meant to be the preferred method because a `UI.Show` request can change the layout of the screen and the screen contents in a single request. This helps prevent lag and screen flashing when an app wants to change an app template. 

An SDL app should only request to view templates that are supported in the HMI Capabilities. The HMI may return a failed response to Core in the event an unsupported template is requested. 

More on HMI capabilities will be discussed later in this guide.

## Supported Template Views

A reference list for all supported template views can be found [here](https://smartdevicelink.com/en/guides/sdl-overview-guides/user-interface/supported-templates/).

This list shows screen shots of the 15 supported template views and how their text, graphic, and soft button components are layed out.

The defined strings for each template can be found in `PredefinedLayout` struct in the Mobile API RPC Specification. 

## Creating the App Menu

The in App Menu should be made accessible from an app's template view. Please note the example placement of the hamburger menu icon in the top right of this screen shot.

 |||

 |||

!!! NOTE
If the user chooses to open the menu, the HMI must send a `UI.OnSystemContext` notification with the `SystemContext` enum: `MENU`. After the user exits the menu, another `UI.OnSystemContext` notification must be sent with the `SystemContext` value: `MAIN`.
!!!

The contents of the HMI's menu are populated by the RPC `UI.AddCommand`. Each `UI.AddCommand` received corresponds to an individual menu item. When the user selects a menu item, the HMI should send a `UI.OnCommand` notification. We believe it is best practice to exit the menu after a user makes a selection from the list of commands.

There is some minor customization for the app menu. An HMI can choose to implement the app menu in a tile view, list view, or both. If an app has a preference for a type of menu layout, the HMI will receive a `UI.SetGlobalProperties` request from SDL Core.

## Implementing Popups

There are several rpcs that are meant to display a popup or an overlay to the user.


### `UI.Alert`

Alert is a simple popup that can contain an image, text, and buttons.

### `UI.PerformInteraction`

`PerformInteraction` is a ppoup with contents displayed similar to the app menu

### `UI.Slider`

`Slider` is a popup that allows the user to enter an input via a slider button.

### `UI.ScrollableMessage`

 |||

`ScrollableMessage` is a popup that allows the user to read a longer message that requires scrolling.

!!! NOTE

It is important that the HMI sends SDL Core a `UI.OnSystemContext` notification when displaying and then hiding a popup. `UI.Alert` is the only popup to have it's own SystemContext enum `ALERT`. All other popups must use the SystemContext enum value, `HMI_OBSCURED`.

!!!

## Navigating Through the IVI

It is common for an SDL UI to be integrated into an existing OEM's UI. In order for SDL Core to work well with a head unit that has other embedded components, the HMI should make use of the `BasicCommunication.OnEventChanged` notification. This notification allows connected SDL applications to receive updates about their HMI statuses when a user interacts with other components like the embedded navigation or radio. For example if an SDL media application has been activated and is playing audio, and a user selects to switch the audio source to the embedded radio, the HMI should send SDL Core a `BasicCommunication.OnEventChanged` notification with `eventName = AUDIO_SOURCE` and `isActive = true`. This HMI notification will let the media application know that it no longer has control of the audio source and its SDL capabilities are overwritten by the embedded audio's capabilities.

If the user selects the media app as the audio source again, the HMI should send the same `BasicCommunication.OnEventChanged` notification, but with `isActive = false`. This will indicate to SDL Core that the application has control of the audio again.

## Defining the UI Capabilities

There are several ways that the HMI should communicate its UI capabilities to SDL Core. When first connecting the HMI to SDL Core, SDL Core will send a `UI.GetCapabilities` request (a similar GetCapabilities request is sent for every interface). The HMI's response should include accurate information relating to supported display capabilities, audio pass through capabilities, soft button capabilities, and other system capabilities. 

It is likely that the UI capabilities will be different for each template view, therefore it is important for the HMI to send updates about its capabilities to SDL Core. For example, if an app requests a new template configuration, after switching to that view, the HMI must send an `OnSystemCapabilityUpdated` notification for the `SystemCapability` type, `DISPLAYS`.  

!!! NOTE
Even though `UI.SetDisplayLayout` is deprecated, the HMI can still receive requests to change layouts from this RPC. It is important that the response for `UI.SetDisplayLayout` includes accurate display capabilities for the new layout.
!!!

As an example, if SDL Core requests to change the layout to the `MEDIA` template, the `OnSystemCapabilitiesUpdated` notification parameters may look something like this (taken from the generic hmi):
